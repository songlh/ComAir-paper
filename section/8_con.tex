\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}

In this paper, we present \Tool, an automated tool that can effectively conduct algorithmic profiling
under both in-house and production-run settings.
\Tool enhances existing algorithmic profiling techniques by 
(1) providing a ranking mechanism to effectively identify root 
causes for performance failures due to complexity problems, 
and (2) significantly lowering runtime overhead 
for enabling algorithmic profiling in production environment. 
The evaluation on 38 benchmark programs shows that, with our designed instrumentation
methods, \Tool can accurately identify the root causes 
of real complexity problems
while incurring a negligible overhead under the production-run setting.
