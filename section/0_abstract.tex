Complexity problems are a common type of performance problems, 
causing by algorithmic inefficiency. 
Algorithmic profiling aims to automatically attribute execution 
complexity to each executed code construct.
It can potentially detect previously unknown complexity problems 
and diagnose performance failures caused by complexity problems. 
However, existing algorithmic profiling techniques 
suffer from several severe limitations, 
missing opportunities to be deployed in production environments 
and effectively guide developers 
to understand and fix complexity problems. 

In this paper, we design a tool, \Tool, which can effectively conduct 
algorithmic profiling under both production-run and in-house settings.
Under the guidance of an empirical study on real-world complexity problems, 
we propose several novel instrumentation methods to 
significantly lower runtime overhead
for the production-run version of \Tool.
We also design an effective ranking mechanism to help developers identify 
root causes for performance failures due to complexity problems. 
Our experimental results show that \Tool 
can effectively identify root causes, 
generate accurate profiling results, 
and incur a negligible slowdown under the production-run setting
to be able to deployed in production environments.
