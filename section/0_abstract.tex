Complexity problems are a common type of performance problems, 
causing by algorithmic inefficiency. 
Algorithmic profiling aims to automatically attribute execution complexity to a code construct.
It can detect previously unknown complexity problems and diagnose performance failures 
caused by complexity problems. 
Existing algorithmic profiling techniques
incur more than $30$ times runtime overhead,
and cannot be deployed in production runs, missing opportunities 
to detect complexity problems escaping from in-house testing 
and to understand how programs scale under real-world workloads. 

In this paper, we present a tool, \Tool, 
which can effectively conduct algorithmic profiling under production-run setting. 
To design \Tool, we first conduct an empirical study on 
real-world complexity problems.
Under the guidance of our empirical study, we then apply 
sampling and a series of compiler optimizations to 
algorithmic profiling to lower its runtime overhead.
In the end, we systematically evaluate \Tool using real-world complexity problems. 
Our experimental results show that \Tool 
can analyze different types of complexity problems, 
generate accurate profiling results for algorithmic complexity, 
and incur a negligible slowdown.
