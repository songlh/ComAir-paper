\section{In-house Algorithmic Profiling}
\label{sec:in-house}

In this section, we present the design and implementation 
of \Tool under the in-house setting. 
We choose RMS as input metric and BB as cost 
metric for the in-house version of \Tool, 
since RMS is more general than DSS and BB is a balance 
between monitoring accuracy and monitoring efficiency, 
sharing the same design philosophy as Aprof~\cite{Aprof1,Aprof2}.
Aprof is implemented under Valgrind framework~\cite{valgrind} .
We will first discuss how we collect RMS and BB under LLVM 
framework~\cite{llvm} in Section~\ref{sec:inhouse_impl}.
Aprof simply attributes complexity to each executed function, 
without providing any postmortem analysis. 
We will then present how we rank identified super-linear 
functions in Section~\ref{sec:rank}.
