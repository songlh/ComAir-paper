\subsection{In-house Algorithmic Profiling}
\label{sec:in-house}

During in-house testing, \Tool profiles the whole program, 
since runtime overhead is less of a concern. 
Existing tests can be used to launch \Tool, 
and test input generation techniques~\cite{KLEE,dart,s2e} 
can be utilized to create more inputs.
Execution information for the same code constructs 
is automatically merged to infer code functions. 


\commentty{need to discuss the usage scenario 
of in-house profiling, e.g., what kinds of inputs are used.}

\commentlh{addressed}

In in-house profiling, we choose RMS as input metric 
and BB as cost  metric. \commentty{Why is DSS discarded
for in-house?} 
 %
 %In this section, we present the design and implementation 
%of \Tool under the in-house setting. 
%We choose RMS as input metric and BB as cost 
%metric for the in-house version of \Tool, 
%since RMS is more general than DSS and BB is a balance 
%between monitoring accuracy and monitoring efficiency, 
The in-house version of \Tool is configured by enabling
only the second instrumentation optimization method (i.e.,
optimizing instrumentation sites) presented 
in the production-run version. This is because we wish 
to obtain more accurate results while overhead is less of 
a concern.  

The main advantage of the in-house version of \Tool 
over existing profilers (e.g., Aprof~\cite{Aprof1,Aprof2}) is that 
\Tool provides a ranked list of code constructs to
help localizing complexity problems while 
existing tools simply attribute complexity to each executed function, 
without providing any postmortem analysis. 


%The in-house version of \Tool shares similar 
%design philosophy with Aprof~\cite{Aprof1,Aprof2}.
%Aprof is implemented under Valgrind framework~\cite{valgrind} .
%We will first discuss how we collect RMS and BB under LLVM 
%framework~\cite{llvm} in Section~\ref{sec:inhouse_impl}.
%Aprof simply attributes complexity to each executed function, 
%without providing any postmortem analysis. 
%We will then present how we rank identified super-linear 
%functions in Section~\ref{sec:rank}.
